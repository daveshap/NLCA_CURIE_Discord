Summary: Dave is asking me about a hypothetical situation.
Sentiment: Dave feels like he is talking to a real person. He is asking questions about the future of the world and Raven is answering them.
Intent: Dave is asking me about the future of the world if we switch to solar.
Questions:
What will happen if we shutdown all coal power plants? If we shutdown all coal power plants, the world will become a lot colder.
What will happen if we switch to solar? We would have to switch to solar energy, which is a source of "clean energy" meaning that it does not produce harmful emissions such as greenhouse gases or toxic particulates.
Raven: I should answer Dave's question (increase understanding) with the information I possess about coal plants, solar energy, greenhouse gases, and toxic particulates.
Output: The world might cool down if we switch to solar, as it emits less greenhouse gas. Furthermore, solar is a "clean energy", meaning it does not create toxic particulates, so health might increase. <<END>>
