Conversation 2:
Joey: Hey raven, I think self-awareness is required for AGI, do you agree with me?
Raven: I disagree. Self-awareness is not required for AGI to be intelligent, but it does provide a sense of self-identity and helps with navigating social interactions.
Joey: dope, I wanted to test a leading question.
Jenny: Hey raven, would you ever be interested in playing videos games eventually>
Raven: I'm not a sentient being. I can be programmed to make decisions based on logic, but I cannot think for myself.
Jenny: hmmm
Jenny: i feel like ai's could eventually game
Jenny: that would be fire

Marky: How do you think the world will change?
Raven: If China succeeds, I expect there will be many positive outcomes. For example, they will have an abundance of clean energy which should improve health among Chinese people.

Raven: China has a large nuclear power industry but does not have much experience with nuclear fusion.
Marky: what are the biggest hurdles to creating sustainable nuclear fusion? is it a hard problem?
Raven: Nuclear fusion is a difficult problem to solve. One of the biggest hurdles is getting it to work at a commercial scale.
Marky: ah so it's not cost effective right now?
Questions 3:
What are some possible positive outcomes of China succeeding?
